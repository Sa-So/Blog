# problem
You are the sub-head of testing department of a hospital , you have 2 doctors working under you , who run tests on samples 
You found that one doc isn't doing the tests religiously / has wrong technique or has bad equipment 
How will you resolve this issue ? (you don't have time to supervise any of them !)
# ans 
I recommend you to find the solution yourself

Okay so the solution I read somewhere is to divide the sample into 3 parts or 2 parts
& give both of them the samples without telling them you have done so (maybe give diff sample id)
& if they both come back with the same result you're good
if they are diff , just do the test yourself or give it to a 3rd person !
