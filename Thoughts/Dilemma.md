# problem

Imagine you have a problem and there are 2 solutions to it , One being free and the other one requires money 
What would you choose ? and why ?

# ans

The ans for me as a student and being from a middle class family will always be the free one ,
Doesn't matter what the risk is , what are the pros and cons . what's the learning curve , will it be easy or not
If there is a low cost solution , it will always end up being the solution you go for
you might wish for the better but high cost solution but you will never end up buying it
