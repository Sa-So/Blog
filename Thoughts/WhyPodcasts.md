# Problem 
I want to create a podcast (because I can make a good podcast than a YT video (bcoz it's quick & easy better than typing )), but Idk how to sell it !?
Why would people listen to my podcast ? wait why do people even listen to podcasts ?
# Ans
- To get knowledge by listening instead of reading ?
- Then why don't they just watch YT videos ! (clearly better than podcasts !)
- but they can't watch YT videos while travelling (bcoz it requires focus (you don't want to miss your stop lol )& hands to hold it) 
- but they can also listen to music right ? y won't they listen to music ?
- Maybe their craving for learning > craving for enjoyment ?
- One more Question to ask is when do ppl listen to podcasts ?
- One best use case I can think of is Listening to it while trying to sleep
- bcoz you wouldn't want to watch YT videos bcoz blue light disturbs your sleep
- & you don't want to hear (non-relaxing music which is most of the music) while you're trying to sleep !
- But for that your voice needs to be soft af maybe do ASMR too (& no knowledge bcoz you're boring your listeners to sleep lol)
- One reason for me to listen to podcast is to hear some1 famous maybe samay raina / Ranveer Allhabadia
- Or a podcast which every1 is hyped about or that podcast give great learnings in short (like book summary)!
- Maybe I need to ask ppl why when how they listen to podcasts.
